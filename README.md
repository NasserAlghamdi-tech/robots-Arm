in the html i used forms to create a plateform to have the sliders in it.
each slider has a div of its own where i applied design using CSS, all sliders have the same design
i used js to show the values of each slider
CSS was used for the design and coloring
implemented the name attribute in html to use it with PHP where i connected my web page with the datebase created using mysql
